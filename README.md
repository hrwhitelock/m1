Physics 2200 Midterm 1 Project

This project compares the Leibniz and Bailey-Bowein-Ploufe(BBP) series for calculating PI. Both are set to run for an increasing number of terms until the error is less than 1e-06. This process is timed, and we have found that on average, it takes 1.368usec for the Leibniz series to have that precision, and 0.18 usec for the BBP series.
